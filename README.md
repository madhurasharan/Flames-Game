# FLAMES Game

Welcome to the FLAMES game created by Madhura S N! üéÆ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Description

The FLAMES game is a fun way to check the relationship between you and your crush (or anyone else) based on their names. It uses a simple algorithm to determine the nature of the relationship through a process of elimination.

## How It Works

1. The game takes two names as input.
2. It calculates the common letters in both names and removes them.
3. Based on the remaining letters, it uses the FLAMES acronym (Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemies, Siblings) to determine the relationship status.
